# 340W Project, NPMM Labeling with Stable Rule Set Classifiers

This project needs julia 1.9 to run. It also needs a valid python distribution as it will install python dependencies.

Package dependencies

Plots, LinearAlgebra, Statistics, DataFrames, CSV, NLsolve, Memoize, MLJBase, Pkg, MLJModels, ScikitLearn, Flux, Zygote, Statistics, StatsBase, PyCall, Dates, MLJParticleSwarmOptimization, StatisticalMeasures, MLJTuning, Distributions, MethodChains, SIRUS

Python Dependencies

ta, pandas, pandas_datareader, yfinance

Results are stored in notebooks airlines, beverages, and tech. The rest of the CSV files are data. Startup and first recompilation times for Julia are long and python dependencies will be downloaded by the script iteslef on first launch to its own Anaconda environment. Both the Julia installations and Python installations can take more than 10 gigabytes of space.
